Basics:

	Run every time to update Pi:
		git pull
		cd /var/www/html
		sudo rm * 
		cd /CS3100/Chatbox4000/Thanks_Gary
		sudo cp * /var/www/html
		sudo systemctl restart mysql.service
		sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
	Run those last two commands after any changes.
	Mysql info:
		Username: root
		Password: JoeMiner
	The Pi should not require a password to use sudo. If it does, something broke and I need to fix it ASAP
	To turn of the system (plese don't just unplug):
		poweroff

1: Update php.ini
	a) navigate to where it is located (mine is in /etc/php/7.0/cli/php.ini but runing 'php --ini' will tell you where it is)
	b) change the line 'short_open_tag = Off' to 'short_open_tag = On'. Should be around line 202. Use Leafpad if it will let you.
2: Import the database:
	cd /var/www/html
	mysql -u root -p < chat_database.sql
	It will ask for a password. The password should be JoeMiner.
